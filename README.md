# react-use-effect-hook

This project demonstrates the use of reacts useEffect hook by implementing three common cases in which this hook will fire. Cases include immediately after the component mounts, when the component updates and right before the component unmounts.

The project uses a counter component where the above mentioned effects will be attached and a logging system that displays the events/effects as they occur. The logging system makes use of reacts useContext in order to mitigate prop drilling.
